What is Blockchain?
A public and secure database to store data.  
This public database can be written and read by using applications (or smart contracts).
Every write is validated by a set of networked computers and not by a central authority before storing the data.  
This "decentralized" ownership/validation of the blockchain is what makes it secure.
Anyone can read the data though.
There are different types of blockchains, like Flow and Solana.

What is a Smart Contract?
A smart contract is an application that defines the rules to transact (read/write data) with the blockchain.  
These "rules" need to be followed in order to make changes to the data stored on the blockchain.
Smart contracts are essentially the first line of defence when securing data stored on the blockchain and thus need to be written as such.
Depending on the blockchain, smart contracts are written using
