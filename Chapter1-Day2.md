What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
- Safety and Security 
- Clarity
- Approachability
- Developer Experience
- Resource Oriented Programming

In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
- The pillars provide the user with the confidence to develop in a safe environment
- Coding in general can be very scary for most as it is very easy to make mistakes and hard to read/write
- The entire Flow ecosystem seems to have the developer and end user experience at top of mind
- Security is paramount is any application and again, it's good to know they've put that as #1
- Clarity & Approachability makes the code easy to read and an easier transition from other coding languages
